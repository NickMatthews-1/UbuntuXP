# UbuntuXP
Wanted Ubuntu or other GTK desktops to look like Windows XP? Well now you can have it! This should work with any GTK type Desktop Environment.

## Install process
All you will need to do is the following
```
chmod +x install.sh
```
```
./install.sh
```
## What does this do?

Well this is rather simply really. First it will update and upgrade you Debian based operating system.
It will then add the "universe" repository to enable the downloading of the Cinnamon Desktop Environment and lightdm.
Then it will extract the 2 zip files you see in front of you.
Then it will create the folders it needs to in the /home/ directory. These are .icons and .themes
From there it will move the unzipped folders into the correct directorys and from there all you need to do is,
log out, change DE at the login screen and login.



I would like to thank you for using my repository today. I hope that you like that you can make your
Desktop WindowsXP themed. (I think its pretty cool). If you came from [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh-uzx7IfPvrqj9xbnDjrbg) and watched the video
on how do this. Thank you for the view and coming across.

If you stumbled across it without having seen my video why not go watch the video and other Linux tutorial videos that I have made!

Thank you for chosing me as your creator of choice. Have a good day!
